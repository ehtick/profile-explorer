# Profile Explorer Overview

Profile Explorer is a tool for viewing CPU profiling traces collected through the [Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-) infrastructure. Its focus is on presenting the slowest parts of the profiled application through an easy-to-use but detailed UI consisting of several views and panels, such as a hot function list, flame graph, call tree, timeline, assembly code view, and source file view.  

The application can be viewed as a companion to [Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer), offering some unique features based on the binary analysis it performs and the IDE-like UI, such as easy navigation through disassembly, improved mapping to source lines, displaying the function control-flow graph, viewing of multiple functions at the same time, marking, searching, filtering and much more.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

Installers for latest version:
- [x64 installer](https://github.com/microsoft/profile-explore/releases/latest/download/profile_explorer_installer_x64.exe)
- [ARM64 installer](https://github.com/microsoft/profile-explore/releases/latest/download/profile_explorer_installer_arm64.exe)

Use the ARM64 installer if you have a machine with an ARM64 CPU, since it includes a native build of the app (no emulation), otherwise use the x64 installer. Note that the x64 app can open traces taken on ARM64 machines and vice versa.  

The app also has a built-in auto-update feature that will notify you when a new version is released and offer to download and install it.  
The installers for previous versions can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/profile-explorer/releases) page.  

## üìñ Documentation

The documentation pages are available here:  
#### [https://microsoft.github.io/profile-explorer](https://microsoft.github.io/profile-explorer)

The app also has a built-in *Help panel* that can display the same documentation.  
Most views have a *question mark* icon in the upper-right corner that opens the *Help panel* on the view's documentation page. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

To build the application and its external dependencies, ensure the following build tools are installed on a Windows 11 machine:  
- recent Visual Studio 2022 with the following workflows:
	- *.NET desktop development*
	- *Desktop development with C++*
	- *C++ ARM64/ARM64EC build tools (Latest)* - for native ARM64 builds
- [.NET 8.0 SDK ](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (should be installed by Visual Studio 2022 already)

From a an *admin* command-line window, run:  
- ```build.cmd [debug|release]``` for an x64 build.  
- ```build-arm64.cmd [debug|release]``` for a native ARM64 build.  

The debug or release build mode is used for the main project; external dependencies are always built in release mode. The admin mode for the command-line is required to register msdia140.dll using regsvr32; it needs to be done once on a machine.  

The build script will update the git submodules, build the main project and external dependencies, and then copy the built dependencies and other resources to the output directory.  

The output directory with *ProfileExplorer.exe* will be found at:  
 ```src\ProfileExplorerUI\bin\[Debug|Release]\net8.0-windows```.  

After the initial build, open the solution file ```src\ProfileExplorer.sln``` and use the *ProfileExplorerUI* project as the build and startup target.

## üì¶ Publishing and creating the installer

To publish the application and create an installer, from a command-line window run:  
- ```installer\x64\prepare.cmd``` for an x64 build.  
- ```installer\arm64\prepare.cmd``` for a native arm64 build.  

This will build the main project as a self-contained application, build the external dependencies, and create the installer executable, with output found at:  

- ```installer\[x64|arm64]\out```  
- ```installer\[x64|arm64]\profile_explorer_installer_VERSION.exe```

Currently [InnoSetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) is used to create the installer and it must be already installed on the machine and *iscc.exe* found on *PATH*.

## üìë Project structure

Below is a high-level overview of the main parts of the application.

| Location | Description |
| --- | --- |
| src/ProfileExplorerUI | The main project and application UI, implemented using WPF. |
| src/ProfileExplorerCore | The UI-independent part that defines the intermediate representation (IR), parsing functions, Graphviz and Tree Sitter support, various data structures, algorithms and utilities. |
| src/ProfileExplorerUITests | Unit tests for the ProfileExplorerUI project. |
| src/ProfileExplorerCoreTests | Unit tests for the ProfileExplorerCore project. |
| src/ManagedProfiler | .NET JIT profiler extension for capturing JIT output assembly code. |

### History

The application started as a tool for helping compiler developers interact with and better understand a compiler's [intermediate representation (IR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation). After adding simple support for viewing profile traces, it gradually gained more profiling features and primarily became a profile viewer.  

Some of the more unique features, such as parsing assembly code into an internal IR, which allows for an interactive assembly text view and the display of control-flow graphs, result from the tool's initial compiler focus.
